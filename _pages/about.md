I am currently a fourth-year computer science Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Beihang University. 
I received the B.S. degree in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2019. 

My research interests include spatial/temporal data mining, user behavior modeling, and graph neural networks.
