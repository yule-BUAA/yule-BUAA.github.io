Brief Bio
======
I am an Algorithm Engineer of [Qwen Team, Alibaba Group](https://qwenlm.github.io/). I am primarily responsible for the alignment of the Qwen series models during the post-training phase.
I received the Ph.D. degree in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Beihang University in 2024, under the supervision of Prof. [Weifeng Lv](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1387/10314.htm). 
I received the B.S. degree in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Beihang University in 2019. 
 
I focus on designing neural networks for representation learning on spatio-temporal data (including texts, sequences, and graphs) and using the learned representations to empower various scenarios. 
My research interests include (large) language models, graph neural networks, recommender systems, etc.
I have published several peer-reviewed papers in top venues like ICML, NeurIPS, KDD, WWW, IEEE TKDE, ACM TOIS, EMNLP, AAAI, and IJCAI.
I have also served as a PC member/reviewer for conferences/journals like ICLR, AAAI, LOG, ACM TOIS, ACM TKDD, IEEE TKDE, IEEE TNNLS, and Neural Networks.
