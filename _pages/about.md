Brief Bio
======
I am currently a fifth-year computer science Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Beihang University, 
supervised by [Weifeng Lv](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1387/10314.htm). 
I received the B.S. degree in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Beihang University in 2019. 

Spatio-temporal graphs can abstractly represent most things in reality. 
I devote myself to designing general neural networks for learning on spatio-temporal graphs, and using the learned representations to empower various scenarios.
My research interests include (spatio-temporal) graph neural networks, language models, recommendation systems, traffic forecasting, et al.
I am strongly self-motivated and aim to pursue cutting-edge AI research.
I have published several peer-reviewed papers in top venues such as NeurIPS, KDD, WWW, IEEE TKDE, EMNLP, AAAI, and IJCAI.
I have also served as a PC member/reviewer for conferences/journals like AAAI, LOG, TOIS, TKDD, TNNLS, and Neural Networks.
